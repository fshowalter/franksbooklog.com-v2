David Goggins escapes an abusive home and overcomes a dead-end career to become a Navy Seal and world-class endurance athlete.

<!-- end -->

A raw memoir that proves as inspirational as it does cautionary. Goggins achieves radical transformations such as losing over one-hundred pounds in three months through megalomaniacal focus. As he says, it's not about motivation, it's about obsession.

Such obsession carries a cost. He burns through personal relationships, runs his body into the ground, and pushes his mind to its endurance limits.

Ghostwriter Adam Skolnick reads the audiobook, but Goggins joins after each chapter for a podcast-like discussion. It's a novel approach that proves the next best thing to Goggins reading it himself.
