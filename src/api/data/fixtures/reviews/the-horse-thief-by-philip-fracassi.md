One humid Florida night, Gabino, an aging horse thief, steals a prize mare for Fat Ted, a black-market middleman. Bad things happen.

<!-- end -->

That's as specific as I can get about "The Horse Thief" without spoiling the story's surprises. It offers a deft mix of noir and horror that proves both unsettling and melancholy:

> When she ran her black coat rippled with underlying muscle like a wind-blown lake in Hell.

Fracassi also shows an aptitude for the hard-boiled genre:

> The only folks coming to see Fat Ted were the folks Fat Ted wanted to see.

I envisioned Fat Ted as a heavier version of Chris Penn's character from <span data-imdb-id="tt0105236">_Reservoir Dogs_</span>. Fracassi's dialog evokes a similar natural cadence and organic tone.

> "Because all these scenarios have a problem, see, and that problem is that it leaves **me** with the **mess**. The mess and the heat. So, you see, **sir**, that we **abso-fuckin-lutely** have ourselves a teensy-weensy problem, all right?‚Äù

Granted, the ending didn't thrill me the way Fracassi intended, but I didn't feel cheated either.
