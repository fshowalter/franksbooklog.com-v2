An accomplished debut collection from Fracassi. <span data-work-slug="altar-by-philip-fracassi">"Altar"</span> shines with <span data-work-slug="mandala-by-philip-fracassi">"Mandala"</span> a strong second. Not a below average entry in the bunch. And I loved the author’s notes section, where Fracassi grants insight into each story’s origin (and confirms my thoughts on the ending of "Mandala").
